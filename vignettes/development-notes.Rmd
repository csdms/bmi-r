This document contains notes on the development of the `bmir` package.
I made choices when designing the package,
and for future reference I'd like to explain why I made them.

## Using an R6 class

I used an R6 class to express the BMI in R.
From my reading,
R6 permits a more natural object-oriented approach when compared to R's S3 or S4 classes.
While BMI doesn't require object-oriented programming,
we've found that, in languages that support it, it helps with the design of clean and descriptive mappings.

An R6 class was also used in [eWaterCycle/bmi-r](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/bmi-r),
which provided inspiration for this version of the R BMI.
